    <h1>Kindle Quran eBook</h1>

    <p>
        Upon purchasing my Kindle Paperwhite, I wanted to read the Quran on it
        with a native Kindle experience. Despite trying over 10 different
        versions, none of them met my preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I decided to create a Quran Ebook for Kindle using different Quran
        APIs, and I have been using this for more than one year and am very happy
        with the experience. I also shared this on GitHub and got one good review,
        so I decided to share it here so that people can benefit.
    </p>

    <p>This Quran Ebook for Kindle has two major features:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Ayah Translation Feature: There is Quran word by word meaning which can
            help you understand Quranic words.
        </li>
        <li>The Quran for Kindle uses Uthmani Quran Script.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        You can go directly download files from the GitHub and start using this
        Quran (it’s Free):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="./Al Qur'an Arabic Personal 1.0 - Allah.kfx">Kindle Quran</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="./quranAyahTranslation2.0.mobi">Ayah Translation</a></li>
        <li>
            <a href="./QuranDictionaryv2.mobi">Word by Word Quran Dictionary</a>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This Quran for Kindle is specifically made for Kindle, but you can also
        use it on other devices (use .epub format).
    </p>

    <p>
        There are two Quran for Kindle file types: .kfx and .epub. I recommend
        .kfx because Uthmani script of Quran is only working in .kfx format. When
        reading, choose publisher font, and you will have the font just like
        below.
    </p>

    <p>
        This Kindle Quran has ayah translation and word by word meaning, but you
        can also read this Quran normally.
    </p>

    </ol>

    <h2>How to Use the Translation and Word by Word Dictionary</h2>

    <h3>
        Word-by-Word Dictionary: To utilize the word-by-word dictionary
        functionality, follow these steps:
    </h3>

    <img
        src="https://github.com/skillhacker-code/Kindle-Quran-Website/assets/68536959/1381f12e-c657-4543-bb90-b43ff033c738"
        alt="Image 4"
    />

    <ol>
        <li>Open the Quran eBook on your Kindle device.</li>
        <li>Long-press on any word in the Quran.</li>
        <li>
            Select “My Quran -> English Dictionary” from the options that appear in
            the dictionary tab.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The word-by-word dictionary will provide the meaning of the selected word,
        aiding in understanding the text on a deeper level.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Ayah Translation: To access the Ayah Translation, follow these steps:
    </h3>

    <img
        src="https://github.com/skillhacker-code/Kindle-Quran-Website/assets/68536959/54a151bd-170e-44f9-8a4b-49e56b6df321"
        alt="Image 5"
    />

    <ol>
        <li>Open the Quran eBook on your Kindle device.</li>
        <li>Highlight the code next to the Ayah you wish to translate.</li>
        <li>Select “Quran Ayah Translation 2.0” from the options that appear.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        The Ayah Translation will be displayed, allowing you to comprehend the
        meaning and context of the selected verse.
    </p>

    <h2>Why English Code is used</h2>

    <p>You can see in the image that the ayah numbers are converted to code.</p>

    <p>
        The Ayah numbers are converted to English code because it was the only way
        to make the ayah translation possible.
    </p>

    <p>I converted 0123456789 to zabcdefghi:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>0 = z</li>
        <li>1 = a</li>
        <li>2 = b</li>
        <li>3 = c</li>
        <li>4 = d</li>
        <li>5 = e</li>
        <li>6 = f</li>
        <li>7 = g</li>
        <li>8 = h</li>
        <li>9 = i</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And put “o” between surah number and ayah to separate it.</p>

    <p>
        That means Surah 1 ayah 7 will be equal to aog, Surah 10 ayah 5 will be
        equal to azoe
    </p>

    <h2>How to Make translation and wbw Meaning Default</h2>

    <p>
        You can also make the translation and word by word meaning default by
        changing settings.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Default Dictionary: You can make the word-by-word dictionary your
            default dictionary. To do this, navigate to Kindle options and change
            the default dictionary setting. This ensures that whenever you
            long-press on a word in any book, the word-by-word dictionary will be
            automatically displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Default Ayah Translation: You can also set the Ayah Translation as your
            default for English. However, keep in mind that for other books, you may
            need to select the dictionary manually.
        </li>
    </ol>
