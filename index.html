    <h1>Kindle Quran With Translation and Word by Word</h1>

    <p><em>This is only for kindle Devices</em></p>
    <p>
      I searched for good quran for kindle device everywhere but didnt get one
      that is suited for me so i developed quran from Quran api from
      <a href="https://quranwbw.com/">Quranwbw.</a> . I am also not a native
      arabic speaker i needed a word by word dictionary , i also created that
      from the same api .
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I created ayah translation from Sahih International translation api .
      I tried many method to make translation work in the kindle but i had give
      codes instead ayah no to get it to work . you will see random codes
      instead of ayah no, dont worry it is used to get the ayah by ayah
      dictionary.
