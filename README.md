Upon purchasing my Kindle paperwhite, I wanted to read the Quran on it with a native Kindle experience. Despite trying over 10 different versions, none of them met my preferences.

So I decided to create a Quran Ebook for Kindle using different Quran Api’s and I have been using this for more than one year and is very happy with the experience and I also shared this on github and got one good review so I decided to share it here so that people can benefit .

This Quran Ebook for kindle have two major feature

1. Ayah Translation Feature
2. There is Quran word by word meaning which can help you understand Quranic words .
3. The Quran for Kindle use Uthmani Quran Script

You can go directly download files from the github and start using this quran (it’s Free): 

This Quran for Kindle is specifically made for Kindle but you can also use it in other devices (use .epub format)

There are two Quran for Kindle file type .kfx and .epub . I reccomend .kfx because uthmani script of quran is only working in .kfx format and when reading choose publisher font and you will have the font just like below .

This Kindle Quran has ayah translation and word by word meaning of but you can also read this Quran normally .

Why English Code are used .
----------

You can see in the image that the ayah numbers are converted to code

The Ayah numbers are converted to english code because it was the only way to make the ayah translation possible

I converted 0123456789 to zabcdefghi

0 = z  
1 = a  

2 = b

3 = c  

4 = d

5 = e  

6 = f

7 = g  

8 = h

9 = i

and put “o” between surah number and ayah to seperate it

that mean Surah 1 ayah 7 will be equal to aog  
Surah 10 ayah 5 will be equal to azoe

How to Make translation and wbw Meaning Default
----------

You can also make the the tranlsation and wbw meaning default by changing settings.

1. Default Dictionary: You can make the word-by-word dictionary your default dictionary. To do this, navigate to Kindle options and change the default dictionary setting. This ensures that whenever you long-press on a word in any book, the word-by-word dictionary will be automatically displayed.
