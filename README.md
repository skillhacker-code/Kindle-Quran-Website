# Kindle Quran With Translation and Word by Word Dictionary


This is only for kindle Devices

I searched for good quran for kindle device everywhere but was not able to find one that is suited for me so i developed quran from Quran api from Quranwbw. . I am also not a native arabic speaker i needed a word by word dictionary , i also created that from the same api .

Then I created ayah translation from Sahih International translation api . I tried many method to make translation work in the kindle but i had give codes instead ayah no to get it to work . you will see random codes instead of ayah no, dont worry it is used to get the ayah by ayah translation.
